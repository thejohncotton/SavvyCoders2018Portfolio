    <p>It is almost a rite of passage for a developer on their journey of learning a language to create a <span class="highlighted">Hello World</span>
    Application of some kind. This application simply produces the greating 'hello world.' So far, I have created my 'hello world' app in the following languages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>Ruby</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Elixir</li>
        <li>Objective-C</li>
        <li>Swift</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I look forward to adding more!</p>

While we learn programming it is important to keep this in mind. That brain pain you are experiencing <strong>is good for you!</strong>
Try to focus on the following every day:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Write new code.</li>
<li>Update old code.</li>
<li>Try new things!</li>
<li>Break things.</li>
<li>Fix them.</li>
<li>Use the command line over your typical file system.</li>
<li>PUSH your code.</li>
</ul>
